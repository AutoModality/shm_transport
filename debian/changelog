  * Manage subscriber number in shm, instead of ros::getNumSubscribers(). Add timeout mechanism in case of ros messages are lost.
  * BUGFIX TODO 1. Subscribe to the same topic in one procedure will be wrong 2. When a subscriber exit, there may be one message left in the shared memory space.
    1. Due to the implemention of normal ROS subscriber, it will be something
    wrong when subscribe to the same topic in one procedure, for the
    publisher will think there is only one subscriber listen to the topic,
    but actually there are two. Maybe we can open an issue on github ros_comm.
    2. When a subscriber exit, the publisher may not know the
    decreace of the number of subscribers, so it still publish
    more message than exactly what is. Then the extra message
    will be left in the shared memory space. If the space is not
    that big or subscribers exit many times, it will throw bad_alloc exception.
  * BUGFIX
    change the condition when publisher is deleted.
